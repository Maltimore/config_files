# make neovim termguicolors work also in tmux
# first, we tell tmux to set the $TERM variable
# to tmux-256color. tmux doesn't work if "tmux"
# or "screen" doesn't apper in $TERM.
# Then we tell tmux to set the color capability "Tc" but
# only if the outside $TERM is "xterm-256color" (which it
# is in Konsole and Gnome-Terminal)
# However if we would start tmux within tmux, the $TERM
# will be "tmux-256 color" (and this
# includes starting tmux locally, then sshing into a
# server and starting tmux there, because $TERM is
# forwarded by ssh). Therefore we need to tell tmux
# to also set "Tc" if the outside $TERM is "tmux-256color".
